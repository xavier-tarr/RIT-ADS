RIT Autonomous Driving Sets

This project aims to create a dataset for testing and developing algorithms related to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and odometry, similar to the KITTI dataset. This project was completed in the spring of 2019.
 
The new dataset, which includes both indoor and outdoor components of RIT college campus, is intended to provide more variation for algorithm testing, including environments that pose challenges for computer vision systems such as close quarters or difficult lighting conditions. 
 
The dataset was created using the HUSKY robot equipped with various sensors including LIDAR, GPS, and cameras, and data was collected using the ROS bag file format. The project aims to provide a resource for improving the robustness of algorithms for autonomous vehicles in a variety of environments.
